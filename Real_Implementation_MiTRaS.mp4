The video below demonstrates a simulation of a platoon travelling along a highway under the PLF communication topology, equipped with model-free off-policy RL-based controller. 
The methodology is implemented using MiTraS, a co-simulation platform, integrating MATLAB with SUMO simulator, exchanging traffic data through TraCI4MATLAB interface. 
MATLAB is a programming language used for modelling the CAVs dynamics, designing tailored control strategies, and simulating communication network topologies. 
SUMO is an open-source road traffic simulator that simulates vehicle movements and visualizes road traffic in urban scenario for cooperative driving manoeuvres.
