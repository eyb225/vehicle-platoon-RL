The video below demonstrates a simulation of a platoon consisting of 1 leader and 5 follower vehicles travelling along a highway under the predecessor-leader following (PLF) communication topology and equipped with model-free off-policy RL-based controller. The methodology is implemented using MiTraS, a co-simulation platform, integrating MATLAB with SUMO simulator, exchanging traffic data through TraCI4MATLAB interface.  MATLAB is a programming language used for modelling the CAVs dynamics, designing tailored control strategies, and simulating communication network topologies. SUMO is an open-source road traffic simulator that simulates vehicle movements and visualizes road traffic in urban scenario for cooperative driving such as lane-changing and overtaking manoeuvres, and more. Additionally, for cooperative driving such as platooning using the DSRC communication, we have used Plexe libraries for SUMO.
